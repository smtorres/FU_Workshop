# 2024 LOOPS Workshop: Image Analysis

Material for the workshop "Image Analysis" (Freie Universit\"at, September 2024)

## Brief description
In this class/workshop we will go over the foundations and techniques for analyzing and extracting content from images. We will cover some "image basics", detail the steps necessary to create a Document-Feature matrix for images (รก la DTM, for texts), review the structure and implementation of a CNN.

## A to-do list while following the class
We will use the a Google Colab machine that has some code and material pre-loaded.
Please follow these steps:

1. Create a Google Drive account
2. Create a Google Colab account with the same e-mail as your Google Drive
3. Copy to your drive the folder "blm_images" from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VxxBq5IBbBfVHIouEdwrRfOHnKs3aVet?usp=share_link). Make sure the folder is still called that way.
4. Create a [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org) account (a free one) and make sure to save the API Key (keep it somewhere)
6. Run the news_api.py file. Make sure you edit and change the lines of code with 1) your API Key, 2) the keywords for your search (optional), and 3) the Drive path where your images will be stored. If you do not have Drive in your personal computer, download the images to a local folder and then upload that folder to Drive.
6. Make sure you can access our Google Colab notebooks and copy them to your Drive
 1. Notebook 1 [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CofDOBFQTxsVoBv_qJlGh2LJF6LrZRmk?usp=sharing).
 2. Notebook 2 [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HsWOE4i3qOY8NV0Dn-zdcnDWoV_g18K1?usp=sharing).

## Links
1. If you don't want to change the terms of the search query for the API, you can download the images from the TRUMP example in class from here: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xwf2L3yANrc3iIWk-D5kqi1bhHwjw3lf?usp=share_link), and then move to them to your Drive.
